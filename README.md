# Master Thesis Template
This is a $\LaTeX$ template for a FCUL master thesis written in English.

The structure of this template has been loosely inspired by the [`templates_latex_fcul`](https://github.com/dpavot/templates_latex_fcul) Github repository.

# Final Work Document Norms
This template follows the official FCUL final work layout version of the 2024/2025 school year, which I have preserved in [normas_trabalho_final_2025.pdf](normas_trabalho_final_2025.pdf). It is your responsibility to verify whether the layout norms have been updated in the meantime. You can find the official FCUL norms [here](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/pt/node/12432/#toc2) or [here](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en/academic-examination-admission-2nd-cycle#toc2).

# VSCode Workspace Settings
This template uses the `biblatex` package for automatic citations in the APA 7th edition format. Therefore, in order to be able to compile your document, you need to include the settings provided [here](src/.vscode/settings.json) in your workspace `settings.json` file.
