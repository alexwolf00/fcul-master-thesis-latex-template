# Master's Thesis Template

This is a $\LaTeX$ template for a FCUL Master's thesis written in English.

The structure of this template is loosely inspired by the [`templates_latex_fcul`](https://github.com/dpavot/templates_latex_fcul) Github repository.


## How To Use This Template

Get a copy of [src](src) and edit the files inside as needed.


## Document Norms

This template follows the official FCUL layout norms for the **2024/2025** academic year, which I have preserved in [normas_trabalho_final_2025.pdf](normas_trabalho_final_2025.pdf). It is your responsibility to verify whether these norms have been updated. As of date of the last commit, the official FCUL norms can be found [here](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/pt/node/12432/#toc2) or [here](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en/academic-examination-admission-2nd-cycle#toc2).


## VSCode Workspace Settings
To be able to compile your document in VSCode, include the settings provided in [src/.vscode/settings.json](src/.vscode/settings.json) in your workspace `settings.json` file. If you copied [src](src) as is, this is already taken care of.
